<h1>Portfolio Page</h1>

<p>I created a professional profile to display my completed projects, describe myself and my professoinal background, and links to various ways to contact me, such as email, telephoe, and GitHub.</p>
<p>The goal of this project was to create said profile from scratch using HTML and CSS to achieve desired functionality</p>
